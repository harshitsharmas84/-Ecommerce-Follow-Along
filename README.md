# E-Commerce Application

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive E-Commerce Application, focusing on building a user-friendly interface and a robust backend. The application will feature a structured folder hierarchy, a React-based frontend, a Node.js backend, and a functional login page.

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

In this milestone, the following objectives were achieved:

- **Project Structure:** Organized the project into separate directories for frontend and backend to maintain a clean and manageable codebase.

- **Frontend Setup:** Initialized a React application using `create-react-app` to build the user interface.

- **Backend Setup:** Established a Node.js server to handle API requests and manage data.

- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Configured Tailwind CSS for streamlined and responsive styling.

- **Login Page Development:** Created a functional and styled login page, allowing users to authenticate and access the application.

  - `public/`: Static assets like HTML files.
  - `src/`: React components and related files.
  - `package.json`: Manages frontend dependencies.
  - `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.

- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js server.
